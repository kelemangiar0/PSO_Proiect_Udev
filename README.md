# PSO_Proiect

to make it run for you:
 - make sure to change the ip in ~/PSO-P/all-scripts/main-script.sh to your server's ip
 - make sure to change server's ip, server's saving location in ./server.c from ~PSO-P/all-programs/client-server/server.c
 - in ~PSO-P/all-programs/client-server/ $ make
 - make sure to "chmod +x *" in ./all-scripts and ./all-programs/server-client
 - $ cd ~/PSO-P/all-scripts
 - $ ./setup.sh

And it`s done

*run the server before the client, and make sure they are in the same network
*you need the PSO-P folder Ã®n your home directory
